      # obtain the key value from an environment variable FOOD2FORK_KEY
      # obtain the url (and/or port) value from an environment variable
      # FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT

      # You will use the http://food2fork.com/api host and port# (default=:80)
      # during development and Heroku deployment. However, your
      # assignment will be graded off-line and should get its host and port# from
      # the FOOD2FORK SERVER AND PORT environment variable. Your assignment
      # must use the defined value if present and default to the real value otherwise.
